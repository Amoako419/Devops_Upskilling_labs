## Critical Issues

### Issue 1: No CloudTrail Configuration
- **Severity**: Critical
- **Description**: No CloudTrail trails are configured in the AWS account, meaning no API call logging or audit trail exists.
- **Impact**: 
  - No visibility into API calls and user activities
  - Inability to detect unauthorized access or changes
  - Non-compliance with most security frameworks (SOC 2, ISO 27001, PCI DSS)
  - No forensic capabilities in case of security incidents
  - Potential regulatory violations
- **Remediation Steps**:
  1. Navigate to AWS CloudTrail console
  2. Click "Create trail"
  3. Configure trail settings:
     - Trail name: `company-cloudtrail-all-regions`
     - Apply trail to all regions: Yes
     - Management events: Read/Write
     - Data events: Configure for sensitive S3 buckets
  4. Create or select S3 bucket for log storage:
     - Bucket name: `company-cloudtrail-logs-ACCOUNTID`
     - Enable bucket encryption with KMS
     - Configure bucket policy to restrict access
  5. Enable log file validation for integrity checking
  6. Configure CloudWatch Logs integration for real-time monitoring
  7. Set up SNS notifications for critical events
  8. Test trail functionality by performing test actions
- **Time Estimate**: 2-3 hours
- **Owner**: DevOps Team
- **Priority**: P0 - Start immediately
- **Verification**: Confirm trail is active and logging events within 15 minutes

### Issue 2: Security Groups with SSH Open to World

- **Impact**:
  - Direct attack vector for brute force SSH attacks
  - Potential unauthorized access to EC2 instances
  - Lateral movement opportunities for attackers
  - Compliance violations (CIS Benchmarks, NIST)
  - High risk of data breach and system compromise
- **Remediation Steps**:
  1. Identify affected security groups:
     ```bash
     aws ec2 describe-security-groups --query 'SecurityGroups[?IpPermissions[?FromPort==`22` && IpRanges[?CidrIp==`0.0.0.0/0`]]].{GroupId:GroupId,GroupName:GroupName}' --output table
     ```
  2. For each security group:
     - Document current usage and attached resources
     - Identify legitimate source IP ranges or security groups
     - Remove the 0.0.0.0/0 rule for port 22
     - Add specific IP ranges or security group references
  3. Implement bastion host/jump server if remote access is needed:
     - Create dedicated bastion security group
     - Restrict bastion access to specific IP ranges
     - Configure internal security groups to allow access only from bastion
  4. Consider AWS Systems Manager Session Manager as SSH alternative
  5. Implement monitoring for security group changes
  6. Document approved IP ranges and review process

     ```json
     {
       "MinimumPasswordLength": 14,
       "RequireUppercaseCharacters": true,
       "RequireLowercaseCharacters": true,
       "RequireNumbers": true,
       "RequireSymbols": true,
       "AllowUsersToChangePassword": true,
       "MaxPasswordAge": 90,
       "PasswordReusePrevention": 12,
       "HardExpiry": false
     }
     ```
  3. Apply policy using AWS CLI:
     ```bash
     aws iam update-account-password-policy --minimum-password-length 14 --require-uppercase-characters --require-lowercase-characters --require-numbers --require-symbols --allow-users-to-change-password --max-password-age 90 --password-reuse-prevention 12
     ```
  4. Notify all IAM users about new password requirements
  5. Force password reset for existing users if needed
  6. Document password policy in security procedures
